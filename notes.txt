2.	Hyperparameters: Experiment with learning rate, number of PPO updates, and clip epsilon.
3.	Reward Design: Ensure the rewards are meaningful and guide the agent toward desired behavior.
4.	Evaluation: Periodically evaluate the strategy to see how it improves over random or heuristic baselines.

1. Keep action_dim Fixed
2. Generate an Action Mask in game logic / loop
